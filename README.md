# Part Descriptions
* The bot contains a total of _ components which are as listed in the following table :


|     Parts    |          Description          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| <p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/motor.png" width="200"/> | Motors - This is the motor we are using, which has </br> dimensions: Length x Dia. 12 x 6 mm and a shaft lenght of 6mm.|
  <img src="./assets/motor_mount.png" width="200"/> | Motor_mount - This is the mount for the motors, which holds </br> the motor, shaft, gears, bearing and magnet.Because of less center-to-center distance between gears, after many iterations this mount was designed.|
  <img src="./assets/tof_mount.png" width="200"/> | TOF_mount - This is the mount for TOF sensor, which is placed </br> in front. We have used VL6180x TOF sensor.|  
   <img src="./assets/IR_mount.png" width="200"/> | IR_mounts - These are the mounts for IR sensors placed </br> at specific angles. SFH-3015-FA and SFH-4045N sensors are phototransistors and IR emitters respectively.|   
   <img src="./assets/gears.png" width="200"/> | Gears - These are the metal gears from sg90 motors having dimensions: </br> Driving gear: Teeth 9, Pr.∠20º, ID x OD 0.5 x 2.14 mm, width 2.46 mm.</br> Driven gear: Teeth 47, Pr.∠20º, ID x OD 1.5 x 9.55 mm, width 1.2 mm.</br> Center to center distance is 5.80mm and modulus 0.195</br>| 
   <img src="./assets/others_1.png" width="200"/> | Bearings, shaft and Wheels - These are the passive components used.</br> Bearings x4 of dimensions: ID x OD 1.5 x 4 mm.</br> Shaft x2 of dimensions: Length x Dia. 15 x 1.5 mm.</br> Wheels with dimensions: ID x OD 1.5 x 12.5 mm.</br> To avoid play and tilt of shaft, we employed two bearings at one end.|
   || IC's and Battery - The IC's used in CAD model are with their actual dimensions.</br> Lipo battery of dimension: 1.5 x 2.5 mm.|

# About The Project

Mushak is a micromouse maze solving bot. The aim of this project is to make India's first and smallest half-size micromouse bot. "Mushak" in hindi means "Mouse"

# Resources
* [Project Futura](http://micromouseusa.com/?page_id=1342) is a tutorial for micromouse designing
* [Micromouse Tyre](http://micromouseusa.com/?page_id=1342) a blog related how to select the tyres for micromouse
* [Phase-lead controller](https://micromouseonline.com/2011/05/16/designing-a-phase-lead-controller/) an alternative to PID control systems for micromouse.
* [Slip Compensation](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/implementing-slip-compensation-into-a-half-size-micromouse) discussion on how to compensate slip in micromouse which becomes a serious issue
* [Kerise v5](https://github.com/kerikun11/micromouse-kerise-v5) Smallest micromouse ever made, contains good documentation of design,pcb and code.

# Acknowledgements
* [SRA VJTI](http://sravjti.in) for providing us with required resources and support.
* [Ryotaro Onuki](https://github.com/kerikun11) for helping with all the designs and technical aspect of micromouse. His willingness to share his experience and answering our question has led to the start of the project.
